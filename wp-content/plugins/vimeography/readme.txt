2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Help! My theme doesn't look right! =

First of all, don't worry! I promise you that we can get it looking right. This can be caused by a multitude of things, so try the following (in the order of appearance):

* Try surrounding your Vimeography shortcode in `[raw][/raw]` tags.
* Make sure that your WordPress theme is not including multiple versions of jQuery and is using the latest version.
* Make sure that your theme is calling the `wp_footer()` function so that all of the Vimeography stylesheets are printed.
* Try disabling other plugins that are used for photo galleries, minifying scripts, widgets, or otherwise alter your site's appearance, one by one, and really determining if you need it.

= I'm getting an error: This Vimeography gallery does not have a theme assigned to it. =

Make sure that you have the latest version of the Vimeography theme plugin that you are using installed and that it is activated. Then, go to the gallery editor and select that theme under the Appearance tab. If you're still having problems, reach out on the Vimeography contact page.

= I'm getting an error: Vimeography error: the plugin did not retrieve data from the Vimeo API! connect() timed out! =

This usually means that Vimeo is having some network issues. Follow @Vimeo on twitter for updates. If Vimeo is not reporting any issues, you'll need to contact your host and ask why you are unable to connect to Vimeo's IP address. It may be that your host has blocked server access via a firewall.

= I'm having trouble installing a theme. =

Vimeography themes are now treated at WordPress plugins. Make sure you're installing the Vimeography theme on the "Plugins" page.

= How do I get the latest updates for my themes? =

If you purchased your theme at vimeography.com, you should have received an email receipt containing an activation code for your theme. Enter that activation code on the "Manage Activations" page of the Vimeography plugin. Once done, you will be subscribed to theme updates which will automatically be delivered to your WordPress installation, just like any other plugin.

= Why don’t you support YouTub/MetaHall/Flacker/PreschoolHumor? =

Like many other video professionals, I believe that Vimeo is a beautiful website complete with clean design, a supportive community and a straightforward API. This makes Vimeo a great choice for professional looking portfolios. Yes, there are other crummier sites that may also do the job, but that’s like forcing down squid nuggets for dinner when you could be having baked scallops and a caprese appetizer. Vimeo only; enough said.

= How do I add my Vimeography gallery to a post or page? =

Easy! All you have to do is type `[vimeography id="#"]`, where `#` is replaced by the ID number of your gallery.

= Where do I find the ID number of my Vimeography gallery? =

Each gallery’s ID number is located next to the gallery’s title in the first column on the edit galleries page.

= Can I override my Vimeography gallery settings in the shortcode? =

Sure thing! You can define all of the properties found in the admin panel right in your shortcode as well. Try using one, any, or all of the following parameters:
`[vimeography id="3" theme="thumbs" featured="http://vimeo.com/28380190" source="http://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks" limit="60" cache="3600" width="600px"]`

= Can I add the Vimeography gallery to my theme’s sidebar/footer/header etc.? =

Yes, but you’ll need some PHP knowledge to do it! Open the file you want to add the gallery to, and type `<?php do_shortcode('[vimeography id="#"]'); ?>`, where `#` is replaced by the ID number of your gallery.

= Can I change the look of my Vimeography theme? =

Heck yeah! Use the appearance editor to change your theme's style so that it matches your site perfectly.

= Can I override my Vimeography theme template with some custom code? =

Sure, why not. Simply copy your theme's .mustache file(s) into a new folder located at `wp-content/themes/[my_wordpress_theme]/vimeography/[my_vimeography_theme]` or `wp-content/themes/[my_wordpress_theme]/vimeography/[my_vimeography_theme]/partials` and hack away. Vimeography will load that template instead of the default one for your theme.
